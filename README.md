1. *An arrow from box A to box B, i.e. `A --> B`, indicates that "A underlies B" or "A establishes B."*
2. *For brevity, in the case of transitive dependency, i.e. `A --> B --> C`, we will not draw an additional arrow from A to C, unless that relationship is crucial.*

## A Nice-to-Have Theorem

Theorem 4.4 says

> (Theorem 4.4) Let p be the dimension of W. Then any independent set of vectors of W consisting of p vectors necessarily spans W.

It's nice to have a "dual" theorem

> (Dual Theorem 4.4) Let p be the dimension of W. Then any spanning set of vectors of W consisting of p vectors are linearly independent.

***Proof*** &nbsp; Let $S = \lbrace\boldsymbol{a_1}, \dots, \boldsymbol{a_p}\rbrace$ be a spanning set of $W$. Suppose $S$ is not linearly independent, then by definition of linear independence, there must be some vector $\boldsymbol{a_k} \in S$ which can be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors in $S$. Then any vector in $W$, which can be expressed with vectors in spanning set $S$, can also be expressed without using $\boldsymbol{a_k}$. That is, $S\ \backslash\ \lbrace\boldsymbol{a_k}\rbrace$ is also a spanning set of $W$. This spanning set has $p - 1$ vectors. But by definition of dimension $p$, the largest linearly independent set in $W$ has $p$ vectors. This contradicts *Theorem 4.3*, which says any linearly independent sets can have no more vectors than do any spanning sets in a given subspace. Therefore, $S$ must be linearly independent. âˆŽ

With the above theorems, we can conclude that given any two of the following three properties, we can readily obtain the third for a set of vectors -

1. is linearly independent
2. is spanning
3. has dimension number of vectors
